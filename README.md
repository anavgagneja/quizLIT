Textbook to Flashcards via NodeJS Magic (HackIllinois 2016/Purdue Demo Day 2016)

Imagine a world where you don't have to spend hours searching through textbooks asking yourself, "Is this going to be on the exam?" Imagine a world where you didn't have to spend hours dealing with hand cramps and writing notes and creating flash cards, a world where you don't have to flip to a glossary to see what something means. 

This is the world we tried to create at HackIllinois 2016 with QuizLit (previously FLSHCRDZ.io). You simply upload a PDF of a textbook or article and out comes flash cards through some node.js magic.

Our stack: node.js (Express.js), CSS/HTML/JS, DuckDuckGo API, IBM Watson API (AlchemyAPI/Document Conversion API)
